make different code acc. to assignment number with extern folder


for each assignement ,use headers folder and files in simple renderer <br>
for linux : cd simple renderer , mkdir build , cd build , make -j8 , run according to mentioned in report<br>
for windows open terminal in visual code: cd simple renderer , mkdir build , cd build , cmake .. , run accoring to mentioned in VScode or terminal as per commands mentioned in respective report
